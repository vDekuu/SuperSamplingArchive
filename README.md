# SuperSamplingArchive
An archive for all versions of DLSS, FSR and XeSS.

# How to use:
- Open the folder containing the downloaded DLL files.
- Drag and drop the desired DLL(s) into the same folder that contains the game's existing DLL(s).

Note: The DLLs will only work if DLSS, FSR, or XeSS is already implemented in the game. They will not work if the technology is not natively supported by the game.
